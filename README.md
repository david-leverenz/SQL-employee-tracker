# SQL Employee Tracker
A MySQL application that allows the user to display employee data in a variety of ways.

## Description
This is a command-line application that accepts user input and runs several MySQL queries.<br>
When you start the application you are presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
When you choose to view all departments you are presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.<br>
When you choose to view all roles you are presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
When you choose to view all employees you are presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.<br>
When you choose to add a department you are prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.<br>
When you choose to add a role you are prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.<br>
When you choose to add an employee you are prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.<br>
When you choose to update an employee role you are prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.<br>

*Bonus*<br>
This app also has pdate employee managers.<br>
This app also has view employees by manager.<br>
This app also has view employees by department.<br>
This app also has delete employees.  I felt it dangerous to allow users the functionality to delete entire departments or roles.<br>
This app also has total utilized budget of a department.<br>
